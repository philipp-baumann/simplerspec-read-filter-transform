# Reading spectra from OPUS spectrometer files: prerequisites

Spectroscopy modeling requires that we first organize our spectra well. 
In particular, a proper and reproducible data management of spectral data,
metadata, and data from reference chemical analyses is key for all the 
subsequent data processing and modeling workflow.

The Sustainable Agroecosystems group at ETH relies on Diffuse Reflectance
Fourier Transform (DRIFT) infrared spectrometers manufactured by the company
*Bruker* (see Figure \ref{alpha_eth}). The manufacturer relies on a proprietary
binary format called *OPUS* to store an extensive amount of data that includes
different types of intermediary spectra. For each sample that was measured a 
single *OPUS* file is produced.

# Reading spectrometer data into the R environment

First, we load the set of packages of `tidyverse` (see
[**here**](http://tidyverse.org/) for details) and the `simplerspec` package
(see [**here**](https://github.com/philipp-baumann/simplerspec/)). Simplerspec
contains a universal file reader that allows to  read selected parameters (e.g.
instrument, optic and acquisition parameters) and all types of spectra from a
single *OPUS* binary file or a list of files.

```{r}
# Load collection of packages that work together seamlessly for efficient
# analysis workflows
library("tidyverse")
# Package that facilitates spectral data handling, processing and modeling
library("simplerspec")
```

I recommended that you set up a self-contained directory where all R scripts,
data (spectra and chemical reference data), models, outputs (figures and text
files of data and model summaries), and predictions live. Further, you
can use the folder structure depicted in figure \ref{project_structure}
to organize your spectroscopy-related research projects.

When you have spectra of various different spectral data sets or that cover
separate experiments and/or different locations and times, you might prefer to
organize your spectra as sub-folders within `data/spectra`. This hands-on will
be based spectral data that have been used to build and evaluate the YAMSYS
spectroscopy reference models. Besides these reference spectra measured with  a
Bruker ALPHA mid-IR spectrometer at the Sustainable Agroecosystems group at ETH
Zürich, there are other spectra that have been acquired to test different
questions such as spectrometer cross-comparisons. Therefore, YAMSYS reference
spectra are contained within a separate path `data/spectra/soilspec_eth_bin`.

In Figure \ref{spectra_files} you can see file explorer screenshot showing
*OPUS* files of three replicate scans for each of the first three reference soil
samples. *OPUS* have the extension `.n` where `n` represents an integer of
repeated sample measurements starting from 0.

We aim to read all the reference spectra contained within this folder. First, we
get the full path names of the file names, which we subsequently assign to the
object `files`:

```{r}
# Extract data from OPUS binary files; list of file paths
files <- list.files("data/spectra/soilspec_eth_bin", full.names = TRUE)
```

Note that you need to set the `full.names` argument to `TRUE` (default is
`FALSE` to get the path of all *OPUS* spectra files contained within the target
directory, otherwise R will not be able to find the files when using the
universal `simplerspec` *OPUS* reader. 

You can compactly display the internal structure of the `files` object using
`str()̀.

```{r}
str(files)
```

The object `files` has the data structure *atomic vector*. An *atomic vectors*
have six possible basic (*atomic*) vector types. These are *logical*, *integer*,
*real*, *complex*, *string* (or *character*) and *raw*. Vector types can be
returned by the R base function `typeof(x)`, which returns the type or internal
storage mode an object `x`. For the `files` object it is

```{r}
# Check type of files object
typeof(files)
```

We get the length of the vector or the number of elements by

```{r}
# How many files are listed to read? length of vector
length(files)
```

Base R has subsetting operations that allow you to extract pieces of data
structures you are interested in. One of the three base subsetting operators is
`[`.

We subset the character vector `files` as follows:

```{r}
# Use character subsetting to return the first element
# Subsetting can be seen as complement to str()
# (1) Subsetting with positive integers (position)
files[1:3]
# (2) Subsetting with negative integers (remove values)
head(files[-c(1:3)], n = 5L) # show only first 5 values
# The first three elements of the character vector are removed
```

Bruker FTIR spectrometers produce binary files in the OPUS format that can
contain different types of spectra and many parameters such as instrument type
and settings that were used at the time of data acquisition and internal
processing (e.g. Fourier transform operations). Basically, the entire set of
*Setup Measurement Parameters*, selected spectra, supplementary metadata such as
the time of measurement are written into *OPUS* binary files. In contrast to
simple text files that contain only plain text with a defined character
encoding, binary files can contain any type of data represented as sequences of
bytes (a single byte is sequence of 8 bits and 1 bit either represents 0 or 1).

Figure \ref{fig_instr_par} shows graphical representation from the *OPUS* viewer
software to get familiarize with types of parameters *OPUS* files may contain.

You can download the *OPUS viewer* software from [**this Bruker
webpage**](https://www.bruker.com/products/infrared-near-infrared-and-raman-spectroscopy/opus-spectroscopy-software/downloads/opus-downloads.html)
for free. However, Bruker only provides a Windows version and the free version
is limited to visualize only final spectra. The remaining spectral blocks can be
checked choosing the menu *Window* > *New Report Window* and opening *OPUS* by
the menu *File* > *Load File*.
