Topics and goals of this section
================================

-   You will learn how to use different R base data structures and basic operations such as subsetting to explore and transform spectral data.

Reading spectra from OPUS spectrometer files: prerequisites
===========================================================

Spectroscopy modeling requires that we first organize our spectra well. In particular, a proper and reproducible data management of spectral data, metadata, and data from reference chemical analyses is key for all the subsequent data processing and modeling workflow.

The Sustainable Agroecosystems group at ETH relies on Diffuse Reflectance Fourier Transform (DRIFT) infrared spectrometers manufactured by the company *Bruker* (see Figure ). The manufacturer relies on a proprietary binary format called *OPUS* to store an extensive amount of data that includes different types of intermediary spectra. For each sample that was measured a single *OPUS* file is produced.
